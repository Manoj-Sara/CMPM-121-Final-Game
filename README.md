## NPC Chase Scene

#### The player can move around the scene by using the space bar to jump around the scene, and gravity physics that allow the player to smoothly transfer from one planet to the next. The goal is to get to the spaceship, which is just out of reach from the first planet you spawn on. However, you can see the path you need to take to reach the final planet.
#### The astronauts on planets will chase the player if the player gets too close, and are signifyed by the orange light and sfx that they emit. They are harder to see on the grassy planet, making the player more cautious in these areas. Coming into contact with an astronaut is game over.
#### If the player jumps on an astronaut's head, they will be temporarily stunned, letting the player figure out where they need to go.
#### The particle system is emitted when the player lands on the ground after jumping, and it's a small puff of dust signifying the player hitting the ground.
#### Rocks and trees around the scene block both the astronauts' and player's movement, with different types of planets having different types of obstacles.
#### The bgm and sfx lend to the game's atmosphere.
